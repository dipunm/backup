# TIP: you can get a list of installed apps using the following command:
# apt list --installed | awk '$4!~/automatic|local/ { print $1 }' | sed "s/\/.*//"
# you should remove packages that you don't recognise since some will be OS packages.
# It may be a large list, but it should be manageable (mine was under 100 lines)
