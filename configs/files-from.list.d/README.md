This folder may contain a list of files to backup. Use this folder if you
would like to separate your main `backup.list` file to keep relevant files
and folders together. You can also share files in this folder if you share 
common folder structures or applications with other users.

Files can be named anything but must use the extension `.list` and must 
remain in this folder without using subdirectories.
